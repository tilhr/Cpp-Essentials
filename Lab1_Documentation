//Using the lab1_part1.cp file, finish implementing the three functions needed for the program to run.
//If you managed to do this correctly, you should be able to replicate the following session:

Enter the name for student #1: Patricia Perez
Enter the age for student #1: 29
Enter the name for student #2: Carmen
Enter the age for student #2: 23
Enter the name for student #3: Albert DeLeon
Enter the age for student #3: 16
Enter the name for student #4: Brandon W Perry
Enter the age for student #4: 54
Enter the name for student #5: Nicole Henderson
Enter the age for student #5: 30

Student #5

//For the second part of the lab, the first thing to do is implement a Student class. 
//You need to use class separation (i.e., create a Student.h and a Student.cpp file) and have include guards. 
//The UML diagram for the Student class is as follows:

//UML diagram for Student class:

  /*Student
---------------
- name : string
- age : int
---------------
+ Student()
+ ~Student()
+ setName(s : string) : void
+ setAge(i : int) : void
+ getName() const : string
+ getAge() const : int


The implementation details should be straightforward. 
To avoid having empty bodies for the constructor and destructor, you should write a cout statement in each of them. 
For the constructor, make it display the message "Student object created!". 
For the destructor, make it display the message "Student object destroyed!".

After creating the Student class, turn your attention to a modified versionPreview the document of the main file from part one. 
Once again, you will need to finish implementing the three functions needed for the program to run.

If you managed to do this correctly, you should be able to replicate the following session:
